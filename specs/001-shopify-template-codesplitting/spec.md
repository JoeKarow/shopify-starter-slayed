## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: What connection speed should trigger "slow network" adaptive behavior? → A: < 10 Mbps (slow 4G/congested networks)
- Q: How should multiple templates be specified for @Template() decorator? → A: Array syntax: @Template(['product', 'collection'])
- Q: When styles have both @critical and @split directives, which takes precedence? → A: Build error - mutually exclusive
- Q: When performance budgets are exceeded during build, what should happen? → A: Fail in production, warn in development
- Q: How far before viewport entry should @LazyLoad components start loading? → A: 1 viewport height below

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- 🚀 Every feature must improve or maintain performance metrics
- 📊 Define measurable performance targets

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A theme developer working on a Shopify store needs to optimize performance without manually managing dozens of CSS and JavaScript files. They add special markers to their stylesheets that automatically split CSS based on which pages need it. Critical styles for immediate display are automatically extracted and embedded directly in pages. TypeScript components use decorators like `@Template('product')` to automatically load only on specific pages, and `@LazyLoad` to defer initialization until viewport visibility. Components adapt to customer network speeds through network-aware decorators. The result is a store that loads in under 2.5 seconds on mobile devices with minimal JavaScript overhead, improving conversion rates and search rankings.

### AI Assistant User Story

An AI coding assistant (like Claude Code) is tasked with building a new Shopify theme from a Figma design or reference site. Starting with the performance-optimized starter template, the assistant implements both styles and functionality using declarative patterns. For the homepage hero section, it marks styles with `@critical` and the carousel component with `@Critical` decorator to ensure instant rendering. Product grid styles get `@split template:collection` while the filter component uses `@Template(['collection'])` decorator to load only on collection pages. Interactive components like image galleries receive both `@LazyLoad` TypeScript decorators and corresponding CSS `@split` directives for coordinated code splitting. The assistant doesn't need to create separate files or manage complex bundling - it simply adds decorators to TypeScript classes and directives to styles. When implementing a mega-menu component, the assistant uses `@Template(['*'])` for global loading with `@NetworkAware` to adapt behavior on slow connections, paired with `@inline` CSS for render-blocking prevention. The declarative syntax makes both JavaScript and CSS splitting self-documenting, allowing other developers (human or AI) to understand the performance strategy at a glance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer adds styles with a template-specific marker, **When** the build process runs, **Then** those styles are automatically extracted to template-specific files
2. **Given** a developer marks styles as critical, **When** the page renders, **Then** those styles are embedded directly in the HTML to prevent render-blocking
3. **Given** a TypeScript component is decorated with `@LazyLoad`, **When** the component is within 1 viewport height of becoming visible, **Then** it initializes automatically
4. **Given** a customer is on a slow 3G connection, **When** they visit the store, **Then** the page loads with adapted component initialization strategies
5. **Given** a developer updates directive-marked styles, **When** they save the file, **Then** hot reload updates the page without full refresh
6. **Given** the build completes, **When** performance budgets are checked, **Then** CSS is under 250KB total and main JS bundle is under 100KB
7. **Given** a TypeScript component has `@Template(['product'])` decorator, **When** a product page loads, **Then** the component JavaScript loads automatically
8. **Given** a component has both `@Template` and `@LazyLoad` decorators, **When** on the correct template, **Then** the component loads only when scrolled into view
9. **Given** a component has `@NetworkAware` decorator, **When** network is slow, **Then** the component adapts its initialization strategy

### Edge Cases

#### Development-Time Prevention (Biome-solvable)

- What happens when conflicting directives are applied to the same styles? *(Prevented by linter rules - @critical and @split are mutually exclusive)*
- How does system handle malformed directive syntax? *(Caught during development with syntax validation)*
- What happens when a component has conflicting decorators (e.g., `@Critical` and `@LazyLoad`)? *(Enforced as mutually exclusive)*
- How does the system handle TypeScript components with multiple `@Template` decorators? *(Enforced single decorator with array syntax for multiple templates)*

#### Build-Time Detection (Partially preventable)

- How are circular dependencies between split CSS files handled? *(Detected and reported during build)*
- What happens when generated files exceed performance budgets? *(Production build fails with clear budget violation report, development shows warning)*
- What happens when decorator-split JavaScript exceeds bundle size limits? *(Warning at development, error at build)*

#### Runtime Handling Required

- What happens when lazy-loaded TypeScript components are needed immediately? *(Graceful fallback to immediate loading)*
- How does the system behave when network quality detection fails? *(Defaults to conservative loading strategy, assuming < 10 Mbps)*
