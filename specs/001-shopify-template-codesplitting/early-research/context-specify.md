## Feature Description

**Advanced Performance Optimization System for Shopify Dawn Theme**

Create a comprehensive build and optimization system for Shopify themes that automatically manages CSS and JavaScript code splitting through declarative patterns, achieving enterprise-level performance metrics (sub-2.5s mobile LCP, <250KB CSS) without manual file management.

## Core Requirements

### Automated CSS Management
- Implement directive-based CSS splitting using PostCSS that recognizes `@split`, `@critical`, `@inline`, and `@responsive` directives within stylesheets
- Generate template-specific CSS files automatically based on directives rather than manual file creation
- Extract and inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content to eliminate render-blocking resources
- Create Liquid snippets for direct style insertion into templates without additional HTTP requests

### TypeScript Component Organization
- Provide decorator-based component registration that automatically loads components based on current Shopify template
- Support lazy loading decorators that defer component initialization until elements are visible in viewport
- Enable network-aware loading strategies that adapt behavior based on connection quality
- Implement automatic component discovery without manual import management

### Build System Integration
- Seamless integration with vite-plugin-shopify for asset management and HMR
- TailwindCSS v4 support with CSS-first configuration
- PostCSS pipeline for directive processing
- LightningCSS for production optimization

### Performance Targets
- Mobile Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds
- Total CSS payload under 250KB across all templates
- Critical CSS under 14KB per template
- JavaScript main bundle under 100KB

### Developer Experience
- Zero manual stub file maintenance
- Clear declarative patterns that AI coding tools can understand
- Hot Module Replacement in development
- Automatic Liquid snippet generation
- Performance budget enforcement

## User Stories

### As a Theme Developer
- I want to add template-specific styles using directives so that CSS is automatically split without creating new files
- I want to mark critical styles with `@critical` directive so they are automatically inlined in the HTML
- I want to use `@inline` directive to create snippets that insert styles directly into templates
- I want TypeScript components to automatically load based on the current template

### As a Store Owner
- I want my store to load quickly on mobile devices so customers don't abandon their shopping
- I want optimal Core Web Vitals scores so my store ranks well in search engines
- I want the theme to adapt to slow network connections so all customers have a good experience

### As an AI Coding Assistant
- I want clear declarative patterns so I can understand and modify the codebase effectively
- I want to use directives instead of file management so changes are consistent
- I want comprehensive documentation so I can provide accurate assistance

## Acceptance Criteria

### CSS Processing
- [ ] PostCSS plugin processes `@split` directives and generates separate CSS files
- [ ] `@critical` directive extracts styles into Liquid snippets for inline insertion
- [ ] `@inline` directive creates snippets with optional lazy loading and scoping
- [ ] `@responsive` directive wraps styles in appropriate media queries
- [ ] Generated files integrate with vite-plugin-shopify's asset pipeline

### TypeScript Components
- [ ] `@Template` decorator associates components with Shopify templates
- [ ] `@LazyLoad` decorator defers initialization until visibility
- [ ] `@Critical` decorator bypasses lazy loading for essential components
- [ ] Components auto-register without manual imports
- [ ] Network-aware decorators adapt to connection quality

### Build Output
- [ ] Main CSS bundle under 50KB
- [ ] Template-specific CSS under 30KB each
- [ ] Critical CSS under 14KB per template
- [ ] Total CSS under 250KB
- [ ] Liquid snippets generated for all directives

### Development Workflow
- [ ] HMR works with directive changes
- [ ] Source maps available in development
- [ ] Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD
- [ ] Compatible with Shopify CLI and Theme Inspector

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page Speed Insights score > 90 on mobile
- Time to Interactive < 3.5s on 3G networks
- First Contentful Paint < 1.8s
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1

### Compatibility
- Shopify Dawn v15.1.0+ compatible
- Works with existing Liquid templates
- Maintains Section Rendering API compatibility
- Supports Shopify's CDN and asset fingerprinting

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns through directives
- Self-documenting code patterns
- Comprehensive error messages
- Automated testing for critical paths

## Constraints

- Must work within Shopify's theme architecture limitations
- Cannot modify core Shopify functionality
- Must maintain backwards compatibility with Dawn theme
- Asset URLs must use Shopify's CDN
- Liquid template syntax must remain valid

## Technical Context

Starting from the `shopify-starter-slayed` repository which provides:
- Basic Shopify Dawn theme structure
- Vite configuration with vite-plugin-shopify
- TailwindCSS setup
- TypeScript configuration
- Existing Liquid templates

The solution will layer on top of this foundation without breaking existing functionality.

## Success Metrics

- Mobile LCP improvement from 7.6-10.2s to under 2.5s
- CSS bundle reduction from 1.4MB to under 250KB
- Lighthouse performance score > 90
- Zero manual file management for splits
- Development velocity increase of 2-3x for adding new features
