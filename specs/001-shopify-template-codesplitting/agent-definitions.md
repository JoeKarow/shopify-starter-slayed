## Usage with /agents Command

### Example Commands

```bash
# Create the PostCSS specialist
/agents new postcss-directive-specialist

# Then paste the specification prompt when asked for the agent prompt

# Create multiple agents for parallel work
/agents new performance-test-engineer
/agents new decorator-system-architect
```

### Launching Agents for Tasks

```bash
# After creating agents, launch them with specific tasks:
/agent postcss-directive-specialist "Implement tasks T023-T031"
/agent performance-test-engineer "Write contract tests T009-T014"
```

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup (Sequential)
1. `setup-specialist` → T001-T008
2. `qa-auditor` → QA-01

### Phase 2: Tests (Parallel)
1. `performance-test-engineer` → T009-T022, T018a-c (all tests)
2. `qa-auditor` → QA-02

### Phase 3: Core Implementation (Parallel)
1. `postcss-directive-specialist` → T023-T031
2. `decorator-system-architect` → T032-T042
3. `qa-auditor` → QA-03, QA-04

### Phase 4: Integration (Sequential)
1. `vite-build-specialist` → T043-T050
2. `qa-auditor` → QA-05
3. `shopify-theme-integrator` → T051-T060
4. `qa-auditor` → QA-06

### Phase 5: Migration & Polish (Parallel)
1. `migration-specialist` → T061-T067
2. `performance-test-engineer` → T068-T073
3. `docs-maintainer` → T074-T076
4. `rum-specialist` → T077-T078
5. `qa-auditor` → QA-07, QA-08

## Key Principles for All Agents

1. **TypeScript First**: Use .ts files unless explicitly required otherwise
2. **TDD Approach**: Tests must be written and fail before implementation
3. **Conventional Commits**: Use format type(TASK-ID): description
4. **Documentation**: Check shopify-dev and context7 before implementing
5. **Performance Budgets**: Enforce CSS<250KB, Critical<14KB, JS<100KB
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure functionality without JavaScript
7. **Declarative Patterns**: Use directives/decorators, not manual files
8. **Parallel Safety**: Different files can be modified simultaneously
